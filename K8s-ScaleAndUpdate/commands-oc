# Commands (Red Hat OpenShift)

## Introduction
- OpenShift projects are Kubernetes namespaces with additional administrative functions. Therefore, projects also provide isolation within an OpenShift cluster.
- Verify that oc CLI is installed
`oc version`
- List the Pods in this namespace.
`oc get pods`
- In addition to Kubernetes objects, you can get OpenShift specific objects.
`oc get buildconfigs`
- View the OpenShift project that is currently in use.
`oc project`

## OpenShift web console
In addition to the CLI, OpenShift provides an intuitive web console. This is a useful and powerful feature because it enables you to deploy applications, view resources, monitor applications and view logs, and much more right in the console.
- Notice the word “Administrator” at the top left. This indicates that you are in the Administrator perspective. There is also a Developer perspective. Each perspective provides workflows specific to that persona. Switch to the Developer perspective to begin deploying an application.
